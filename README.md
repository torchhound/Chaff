=====

This program sends search requests repeatedly every few seconds. It is designed to confuse anyone surveilling your 
network traffic. This project is written in python 3.5. It was inspired by the browser extension TrackMeNot.

Planned Features:
=====

- Add additional search engines(FAROO, Google Custom Search) perhaps switching between them randomly

- Add command line options(argparse)

- Add logging

 - Add JSON parsing of results
